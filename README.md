# LsfWin
A graphical UI library written in Turbo Pascal 5.5.

This TurboPascal unit (equivalent of a DLL) has been written when i was 19yo.
It implement a graphical theme inspired from the Next UI.

The code is fully object oriented and use the concept of event  (Click event on a Button object :) ).

I write and use this library for my student work (like the "Grignotte" game in the demo).
