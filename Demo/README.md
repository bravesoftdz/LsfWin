# LsfWin - DEMO	
A demo of the LsfWin unit.

This demo is build for a DOS session (16bits executable).  It does not work in a Windows command line session. 
You should start a virtual machine running a DOS compatible OS (MSDOS, FreeDos, ...)

A VHD with a FreeDos installation plus the demo executable is downloadable here :
